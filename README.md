# 2048 Game  

## Overview  
This project aims to implement the classic 2048 game using Python. The game will allow players to slide tiles on a grid, combining tiles with the same number to reach the target score of 2048.  

## Features  
- **Interactive Gameplay**: A playable version of the 2048 game with a user-friendly interface.  
- **Game Logic**: Handles tile movement, merging, and random tile generation.  
- **Winning and Losing Conditions**: Tracks the game's end conditions for player feedback.  

## Technology Stack  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Library**: TBD (e.g., `pygame` for graphical interface or terminal-based logic)  

## Goals  
- Build core game mechanics for 2048.  
- Optionally integrate a graphical interface for enhanced user experience.  

## Future Enhancements  
- Add sound effects and animations.  
- Implement a scoring leaderboard.  
- Explore AI to play the game automatically.
